## 前言

来到SAP实习的日子里，或多或少也发过英文邮件，但写邮件时可能有些别扭。基于这个背景，今天就为大家到来一些英文邮件的写法分享。

***

## 概要

英文邮件可以分为四个部分：开头、目的、正文和结尾。本文将围绕这四个点来展开。

## 开头

- 征求意见

	> Please advise.
	> Please give your comments if any.

- 道歉

	> My sincere apology for this unfortunate situation.

***

## 正文

- 要简单明了（clear and concise）

- 表示强调时一般不将一个句子全部大写，而是将其加粗。

	> **Please review the attached documents thoroughly.**

- 更加native的用法

<table><tr><th>Normal</th><th>Better</th></tr><tr><td>but</td><td>however</td></tr><tr><td>and</td><td>so that</td></tr><tr><td>because</td><td>since / as / for</td></tr><tr><td>because of</td><td>due to</td></tr><tr><td>/</td><td>both...and / either...or / neither...nor</td></tr></table>

## 一个英文商务邮件的范例

> Dear Ms. Jones,

> Hope everything is well with you. Thank you for reaching out to us regarding price quotations for hardwood flooring. Please see the attached document for a preliminary quotation. These quotes will vary greatly depending on your choice of board width, texture, color, finish etc. Once our technicians assess the space you wish to install new flooring in, we will be able to provide you with a more accurate quote. I have also attached photos of several of the wood samples we currently have in stock.

> If you have any further questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to contact me. Please let me know if you decide to move forward with the assessment, and I look forward to hearing from you.

> Sincerely,
John Smith
Sales Representative, Flooring Company
